# Lazy-Load-Image-Grid-Layout-With-JS
Lazy load helps browsers load images  on scroll. 
It is an easier way of loading images compared to loading all of them at once particularly when one works with high-resolution images.
It works by using an event listener(window.onscroll)
There is a loading gif('src' attribute) that works while the rest of the images on a page loads('data-src' attribute).
